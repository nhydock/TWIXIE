<Room name = "Dungeon Cell" >
	<Description>
		You are in a dark dungeon. The air is musty, and
        there is no light, save what little leaks through
        the bars of the cell's door from a burning torch
        in the hall outside. You hear some moaning in the
        distance, but aside from that, you are alone.
