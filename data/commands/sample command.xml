<!--
    Here is an example of an obscenely convoluted Command. First, the Command
    creates a new Item, with an in-line definition. This new Item also has a
    Command, which also creates a new Item in-line. The final Item again has a
    Command, which adds a new path to a Room. Please, if you can, describe all
    of your Rooms, Items, and Commands in separate files, and link them via
    their names instead.
